### Synthetify

**Synthetify** is a decentralized synthetic assets protocol build on [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain. The protocol allows for creation and exchange of synthetic assets that closely track the price of specific assets. Synthetic tokens are based on [SPL-Token](https://spl.solana.com/token) standard that gives them ability to be easily integrated with other DeFi applications like AMM.

Synthetify leverages Solana ecosystem to enable fast, cheap and intuitive trading experience for users of the platform while keeping it fully decentralized thanks to an infrastructure build on top of a number of smart contracts and blockchain oracles.

Synthetify doesn't use an orderbook, which means no slippage (the price stays the same no matter the size of the trade) even in a volatile market.

SNY is the only collateral token currently supported by Synthetify platform. The Token gives Stakers ability to issue synthetic tokens and entitles them to a share of fees generated by the platform. In the future SNY will give voting power that owners will be able to use to adjust protocol parameters or list new assets.
