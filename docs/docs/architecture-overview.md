Almost all Synthetify functionalities are deployed with one smart contract. The only exception is providing price data.

### SPL-token

All synthetic assets are [SPL-token](https://spl.solana.com/token) based, what enables further usage on other platforms like AMM's wirh nearly frictionless integration.

### Pyth Oracle

Pyth Oracle provides prices of underlying asset from decetralized oracles.
