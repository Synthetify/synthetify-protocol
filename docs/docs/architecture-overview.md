### Smart Contract

Almost all Synthetify functionalities are deployed within one smart contract. The only exception is price data provision.

### SPL-token

All synthetic assets are [SPL-token](https://spl.solana.com/token) based, which enables further usage in other platforms like AMMs with nearly frictionless integration.

### Pyth Oracle

Pyth oracle provides prices of underlying assets from decentralized oracles.
