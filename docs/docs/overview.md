### Participants

Users of Synthetify protocol could be divided into three roles:

- Staker
- Traders
- Liquidator

### Staker

A Staker is responsible for initial creation of debt and synthetic assets. Stakers lock their SNY tokens inside smart contract and use it to create synthetic USD (xUSD) that later can be exchanged for other types of synthetic assets. In reward for creating liquidity for Traders and acting as the opposite side of trades performed on Synthetify exchange, they receive pro rata fees generated by exchange and inflation rewards. To unlock SNY tokens Stakers need to burn synthetic tokens equal to value of their debt. All Stakers need to maintain sufficient collateral ratio or part of their collateral can be liquidated to ensure network safety. Collateral is dependent on the price of SNY token and debt is calculated based on their share of debt of the entire platform.

### Trader

A Trader performs exchanges of assets using Synthetify exchange. To engage in trading activity a trader needs firstly to buy synthetic assets from other markets like centralized exchanges or mint it himself by acting as a Staker. Traders do not need SNY tokens to perform trades.

### Liquidator

To ensure safety and solvency of the protocol, Liquidator can pay off debt of under collateralized Staker and receive fair share of Staker's collateral. Liquidation includes penalties of 80% what is transferred to Liquidators and 20% to an Exchange owned account to improve platform stability.

### An example

This example explains the core mechanism of Synthetify and the risks of participating in debt pool.

![Table of sums for the example](https://i.imgur.com/avSuATV.jpg)

**Step 1** Both Alice and Olivia have the same amount of debt (50%). Entire debt is equal to $10k. Olivia holds $5k synthetic USD and Alice holds $5k synthetic SOL.

**Step 2** The price of xSOL doubles making Aliceâ€™s balance worth $10k this causes debt to rise to $15k. Olivia still holds xUSD and the value of this token is stable.

**Step 3** Both Alice and Olivia are still responsible for the entire debt of the protocol each for 50% of it. Debt increased by $5k so the debt of Alice and Olivia will rise by $2.5k. When we match positions against owned debt for Alice and Olivia, we see that Alice ended up with $2,5k profit and Olivia lost $2,5k since her debt increased by this amount.
