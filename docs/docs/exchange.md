### Asset to sell

In the _From_ section, you can choose an asset you want to sell. In the top right corner, you can see information about your balance of the chosen asset. _Set to max_ button fills the field with the maximum available amount of the asset.

If you know how much of an asset you want to have after a transaction is completed, but you do not know how much needs to be sold, go to the [_To_](/docs/exchange#asset-to-buy) section.

### Asset to buy

In the _To_ section, you can choose an asset you want to buy. Due to market price fluctuations, the amount of the asset is an estimated value. If you filled an amount in the _From_ field you can see how much of the asset you will get. _Set to max_ button fills the field with the maximum available amount of the asset.

If you know how much of an asset you need to have after the transaction is completed, but you do not know how much needs to be bought, go to the [_From_](/docs/exchange#asset-to-sell) section.

Between _From_ and _To_ section, there is an icon depicting two arrows. It swaps assets places. After clicking on it, the asset which was in _From_, will be in _To_ and vice versa.
